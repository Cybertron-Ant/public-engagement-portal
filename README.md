A public engagement platform for stakeholders to collect statistical data within a target region

The Public Engagement Portal

Broken Experience:
Governments and Organizations collect statistical data to support projects, initiatives and various types of engagements with the public. A single yet multi-purpose tool for collecting statistical data from the public would be useful to these entities.

Solution:
The Public Engagement Portal is a platform that allows the public to directly provide relevant data to channels that is then analyzed and summarized then presented to both the public and stakeholders for taking action.

Example Use Case:
Across communities in Jamaica a significant number of roadways are damaged and they go years without being repaired. Resources are normally allocated to repair roads annually by the parish councils however most times the areas that need the most work done arenâ€™t actually addressed. The public engagement portal can be used to request statistical data from members of the public to help better identify areas across the island that require more resources pooled into road repairs than others. Users would submit posts to a channel dedicated to identifying damaged roads, their posts would then be analyzed and relevant data grouped and presented in charts and graphs and made exportable to portable formats. This information would also be useful for being forwarded to the relevant government body in helping to identify areas the public believes are in need of more road repairs.
